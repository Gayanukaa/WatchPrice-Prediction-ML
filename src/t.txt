We used pandas dummy module to transform for categorical variables. But it's doesn't always work especially when you have higher number of categories.
Pandas dummy sees all the variables and converts. But during prediction we pass only one at a time. Model will not know what the other values are. Because other values are also in dimensions.
Instead we use sklearn one-hot encodings.
